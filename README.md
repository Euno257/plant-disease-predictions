# Plant Disease Prediction

### Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/saroz014/plant-diseases
### Objective: Using Resnet34 to classify infected plant leaf on the basis of crop type and detected infection.

The dataset conatins more than 200,000 images of different crops separated by their infection type.
Used fastai library (built on Pytorch). Achieved an accuracy of about 99.97%.

Built a Web-App which predicts the plant disease by analysing their leaf image.

### Create a virtual environment 
<code> $ virtualenv pla --python=python3.6 </code>
<p><code> $ source pla/bin/activate </code></p>
 
### Install dependencies
 Install fastai using pip3
<p><code> pip3 install fastai </code></p>
